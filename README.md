# MMH_PSO_ElwannasHIRI
### Followed process to build PSO algorithm using python
0. [x] SetUp the Enviorement
      1. [x] Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)   
            * Version 3.6 ~ 3.8  Required by Streamlit library
      <!-- 2. [x] Install [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)
            * Follow the[intsructions](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/) to install [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).
            * [Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) 
      3. [x] For this project I am using Matplotlib       -->
1. [x] Build [PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) algorithm.
      1. [x] Understanding how the algorithm works.
      2. [ x Create some random example (without interface).
2. [x] Create the UI using Streamlit.
      1. [ ]  Main window.
      2. [x]  Variables.
3. [ ] Extended features.
      1. [ ] Add animations.
      2. [ ] Implement another algorithm. 


## Set Up the enviorement


## Build  [PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) Algorithm
Thanks to [Marco](https://github.com/marcoscastro/tsp_pso) who build the system with random values and no GUI. I added some sections to adabt the algorithm to accept data from files and show the excution process.


### usage 

1. Download the data file.
2. Count number of lines to be skipped 
3. Run the algorithm "python3 tsp.py"
4. enter the number of cities
5. Enter the number of line to be skipped
6. Enter the file name.
7. Watch the results.


### 1.1 Understanding how the  [PSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) algorithm works 
To get general idea about  algorithm I read these tutorials:
      1. [PSO Tutorial "swarmintelligence"](http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php) 
      2. [Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) by Mr.OMARI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1obsX6IpaoL9sw-yi2Sr2XAq43MkkPEWx/view), 
      3. [The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~simhaweb/champalg/tsp/tsp.html), very recomanded
